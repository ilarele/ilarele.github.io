  summary: We formulate object segmentation in video as a graph partitioning problem in space and time, in which nodes are pixels and their relations form local neighborhoods. We claim that the strongest cluster in this pixel-level graph represents the salient object segmentation. We compute the main cluster using a novel and fast 3D filtering technique that finds the spectral clustering solution, namely the principal eigenvector of the graph's adjacency matrix, without building the matrix explicitly - which would be intractable. Our method is based on the power iteration for finding the principal eigenvector of a matrix, which we prove is equivalent to performing a specific set of 3D convolutions in the space-time feature volume.

  summary: We propose a deep neural network composed of different parts, which functions as a society of tracking parts. They work in conjunction and learn from each other using co-occurrence constraints that ensure robust inference and learning. Our network is composed of two main pathways. One pathway is more conservative, carefully monitoring a large set of simple tracker parts learned as linear filters over deep feature activation maps. We learn these filters simultaneously in an efficient way, with a single closed-form formulation, for which we propose novel theoretical properties. The second pathway is more progressive. It is learned completely online and thus it is able to better model object appearance changes. The larger set of simpler filter parts offers robustness, while the full deep network learned online provides adaptability to change. Thus, our system has the full benefit of two main approaches in tracking.

  summary: We obtain robustness against background with a tracker model that is composed of many different parts. They are classifiers that respond at different scales and locations. The tracker system functions as a society of parts, each having its own role and level of credibility. Reliable classifiers decide the tracker's next move, while newcomers are first monitored before gaining the necessary level of reliability to participate in the decision process. Some parts that loose their consistency are rejected, while others that show consistency for a sufficiently long time are promoted to permanent roles. The tracker system, as a whole, could also go through different phases, from the usual, normal functioning to states of weak agreement and even crisis.
